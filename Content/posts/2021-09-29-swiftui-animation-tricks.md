# SwiftUI Animation Lessons From Building ‚ÄúTime‚Äôs¬†Up!¬†Timer‚Äù

I recently launched **[Time‚Äôs¬†Up!¬†Timer](https://overdesigned.net/timesup/)**, a kid-friendly timer app for iOS, macOS, and tvOS. It‚Äôs a SwiftUI app that makes heavy use of animations, so I thought I‚Äôd share a few of the SwiftUI animation tips and tricks I‚Äôve learned building it.


## Use `animation(_:value:)` instead of `animation(_:)`

Let‚Äôs start with the simplest lesson: always use `animation(_:value:)` for implicit animations. Unlike the simpler `animation(_:)` modifier, this also requires an `Equatable` value parameter; the animation will *only* be applied when that value changes. Without this, the animation may run when other properties change or during transitions.

<figure class='fixed'><img src="/images/swiftui-animation-1.gif" alt="Animated GIF of a springy clock hand." /></figure>

Here‚Äôs an excerpt from the code for my timer view, which draws a clock face and a hand. The hand moves with a bouncy spring animation when its `angle` changes ‚Äî and *only* when its `angle` changes ‚Äî thanks to `animation(_:value:)`.

```swift
struct TimerClockfaceView: View {
    @State var angle: Angle
    
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            makeFace()
        
            makeHand()
                .rotationEffect(angle)
                .animation(.interactiveSpring(), value: angle)
        }
    }
}
```

The value-less version of `animation(_:)` is deprecated as of iOS 15 / macOS 12, which means Apple agrees: always use `animation(_:value:)`.


## Always test device rotation

Speaking of unwanted animation: SwiftUI views will animate to their new sizes when you rotate your iPhone or iPad, and this may produce some undesirable results. I recommend testing device rotation in the simulator with **Debug &rarr; Slow Animations** enabled so you can see exactly what‚Äôs happening and fix it.


## Respect your user‚Äôs Reduce Motion setting

iOS has a **Reduce Motion** accessibility setting, which disables or simplifies most animations. Try it yourself by going to **Settings &rarr; Accessibility &rarr; Motion &rarr; Reduce Motion.** Third-party apps like ours should respect this setting too, and with SwiftUI it‚Äôs incredibly easy.

```swift
struct TimerClockfaceView: View {
    @State var angle: Angle
    @Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion) var reduceMotion
    
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            makeFace()
            
            makeHand()
                .rotationEffect(angle)
                .animation(reduceMotion ? .none : .interactiveSpring(),
                           value: angle)
        }
    }
}
```

We first read the user‚Äôs preference using the `\.accessibilityReduceMotion` environment value, then use a ternary operator in `animation(_:value:)` to set the animation to `.none` if `reduceMotion` is true.


## Use `withTransaction` to override implicit animations

Here‚Äôs a snippet of code from my main view, which shows the timer, the remaining time as `Text`, and a **Reset** button that will reset the timer with a nice (slow) `.default` animation.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject var timer: TimesUpTimer
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text(timer.remainingTimeString)
                .font(.title)
            TimerClockfaceView()
                .aspectRatio(1, contentMode: .fit)
            Button("Reset") {
                withAnimation(.default) {
                    timer.reset()
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

And here‚Äôs a capture of what happens when I tap **Reset**.

<figure class='fixed'><img src="/images/swiftui-animation-2.gif"/></figure>

It‚Äôs not working as expected ‚Äî the implicit spring animation on the clock hand hand is overriding the explicit `withAnimation` in our Reset function. How can we *override* the spring animation?

The solution is `withTransaction`, which is similar to `withAnimation` except it takes a `Transaction` object. A `Transaction` represents the *context* of the current state-processing update, including the animation that will be applied.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject var timer: TimesUpTimer
    
    var body: some View {
        ...
        Button("Reset") {
            var transaction = Transaction(animation: .default)
            transaction.disablesAnimations = true
            withTransaction(transaction) {
                timer.reset()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

First we create a `Transaction` with the `.default` animation we want. Then we set the Transaction‚Äôs `disablesAnimations` property to true, which tells it to disable all *implicit* animations on the affected views. Finally, we call `withTransaction(_:_:)` like we would `withAnimation(_:_:)`, providing our transaction and a closure to execute.

<figure class='fixed'><img src="/images/swiftui-animation-3.gif"/></figure>

Looks good!

(Actually `Animation.default` is pretty lame and I don‚Äôt actually use it in my app, but you get the idea!)

## Use `transaction(_:)` to override explicit animations

Now if you look closely at that last animation, you may notice something else that doesn‚Äôt look right: when we tap **Reset**, the time `Text` view changes size and that change is animated.

<figure class='fixed'><img src="/images/swiftui-animation-4.gif"/></figure>

Yuck. Let‚Äôs disable that animation using `transaction(_:)`, which is a View Modifier that lets us change or replace the `Transaction` being applied to the view when we called `withAnimation` or `withTransaction`. In this case, we want no animation for the `Text` so we set `transaction.animation` to `.none`.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject var timer: TimesUpTimer
    
    var body: some View {
    	Text(timer.remainingTimeString)
    	    .transaction { transaction in
    	        transaction.animation = .none
    	    }
    	...
    }
}
```

Here‚Äôs the final result: the hand animates smoothly while the time snaps to its new value immediately.

<figure class='fixed'><img src="/images/swiftui-animation-5.gif"/></figure>

This is a very simple use of `transaction(_:)` but many things are possible: you could change to a different animation, add a delay, or change the current animation‚Äôs duration. It‚Äôs pretty cool.

One word of warning from the [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Form/transaction%28_:%29):

> Use this modifier on leaf views such as `Image` or `Button` rather than container views such as `VStack` or `HStack`. The transformation applies to all child views within this view; calling `transaction(_:)` on a container view can lead to unbounded scope of execution depending on the depth of the view hierarchy.


## For animation-heavy Mac apps, consider Catalyst

[Time‚Äôs Up! Timer](https://overdesigned.net/timesup/) is available for iOS, macOS, and tvOS, which required some platform-specific optimizations.

For tvOS, testing on real hardware is key because Apple TV boxes are relatively underpowered. I simplified a few views and animations to compensate.

The Mac app was more of a problem, in a way I didn‚Äôt expect: **SwiftUI animations run very poorly on macOS 11** (I have not done performance testing on macOS 12). I tried using `drawingGroup()` everywhere I could, but that wasn‚Äôt enough. My eventual solution was to abandon my ‚Äúnative‚Äù macOS app and switch to a Catalyst app, where animations run great! ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

So my advice for animation-heavy SwiftUI Mac apps is to consider Catalyst. Catalyst may not be a good trade-off for many apps ‚Äî you can‚Äôt use `.toolbar` to make Mac toolbars, and you have no access to macOS-only APIs like `.commands` or `Settings` ‚Äî but for whatever reason, SwiftUI animations run much, *much* better in Catalyst apps.
